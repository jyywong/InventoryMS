# Inventory Management System

### What is this?
This is a site aimed at members of a scientific lab, to help them keep track of their inventory. You can see different inventories and different items all in one place, see how much is left, and request and order on the webapp. 


### What problem does this solve?
Most scientific labs use some sort of whiteboard or paper to keep track of their stock. By using this web app, it would be easier to keep track of stock, and can provide a way to see how much of one item is being used over time.
